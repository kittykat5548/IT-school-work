    <h1>Welcome to my Portal Page!</h1>
    <h2>IT 162 Winter 2023</h2>
    <p><i>Hi my name is Talana,</i>  I am taking this class because I want to design safe web platforms for children.
    as well as I would love to design video games for people with disabilities such as <strong>Autism, Asperger's, exd.</strong>
    I have taken a it100 and it161 before, I am also currently in 1t120. I hapen to be extreamly well with electronics and a very quick study. My passions include playing video games
    doing lots of art. As you can see by my background I also have a fascination with dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
    The main reason that I have decided that this is what I want to do, would be my kids. I want to do something that they and myself can be proud of. Being a mom I worry about wether or not my children are safe on a lot of platforms. I also have friends and family that had disabilities that love playing video games but have a hard time understanding them.
    So my inspiration comes from all the wonderful people in my life.
    </p>
